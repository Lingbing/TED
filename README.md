EventDetection
==============


This package can be used to detect and classify physical events from turbulence time series. The event detection step recognises events as the subsequences which are significantly different from noise. It does not reply on pre-assumption of events in terms of their magnitude, geometry, or stationarity.  The event classification step is to classify the events into groups with similar characteristics.  Examples can be found for both artificial data and real world turbulence data.
